# ApartmentScouting
The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly platform that caters to the unique needs of international students seeking accommodation near their college campus. The platform will allow students to post apartment listings and communicate with local scouts who can visit and verify the apartments in person.


# Apartment Scout

Apartment Scout is a web application designed to help international students find suitable apartments near their college or university by connecting them with local scouts who can visit, verify, and document the apartments on their behalf. The platform is built using Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and aims to save time and resources for both students and scouts.
